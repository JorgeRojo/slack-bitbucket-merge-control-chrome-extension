# Slack-Bitbucket Merge Control Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension designed to read messages from specified Slack channels (both public and private) and control merge button availability on Bitbucket pull request pages. The extension popup displays the current merge status and the latest matching message that determined the merge control decision.
