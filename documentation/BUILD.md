# Build Process Documentation

This document explains the modern Vite-based build process for the Chrome extension.

## Overview

The project uses a **hybrid build system** optimized for Chrome Extensions:

- **Vite** for main application files (background, popup, options) with modern bundling
- **esbuild** for content script in IIFE format (Chrome Extension requirement)
- **Static file copying** for HTML, CSS, images, and manifest.json
- **TypeScript compilation** with full type checking and source maps

## Build Scripts

### `npm run build`

Main build command using the Vite + esbuild hybrid approach:

- Uses **Vite** to bundle background, popup, and options scripts with modern optimizations
- Uses **esbuild** to create IIFE-format content script for Chrome Extension compatibility
- Copies all static files (HTML, CSS, images, manifest.json) to dist directory
- Generates optimized bundles with source maps and compression analysis
- Provides detailed build summary with file sizes and performance metrics

### `npm run build:vite-only`

Pure Vite build (for testing and development):

- Uses only Vite for all files including content script
- May not be Chrome Extension compatible for content scripts (uses ES modules)
- Useful for development, testing, and analyzing bundle composition
- Generates detailed chunk analysis and dependency graphs

### `npm run clean`

Removes the `dist/` directory completely.

### `npm run type-check`

Runs TypeScript compiler in check-only mode (no output files):

- Useful for checking types without building
- Shows all TypeScript errors without stopping the build

### `npm run build:tsc`

Uses the standard TypeScript compiler directly:

- More strict than our custom build script
- Will fail if any TypeScript errors exist

## Build Output

The build process creates a `dist/` directory with the following structure:

```
dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ background.js           # Main background script
â”œâ”€â”€ content.js             # Content script for Bitbucket pages
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.js               # Popup interface
â”œâ”€â”€ options.js             # Options page
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json          # Chrome extension manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ components/            # UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                 # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ types/                 # TypeScript type definitions (compiled)
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/                # CSS files
â””â”€â”€ images/                # Extension icons
```

## TypeScript Migration Status

The project is in active TypeScript migration. Current status:

### âœ… Fully Migrated

- Type definitions (`types/`)
- Utility functions (most of `utils/`)
- UI components (`components/`)
- Constants and literals

### ðŸ”„ Partially Migrated

- Background script (TypeScript exists, but has type errors)
- Content script (TypeScript exists, but has type errors)
- Popup script (TypeScript exists, but has type errors)

### ðŸ“‹ Using JavaScript Fallbacks

When TypeScript compilation fails, the build system automatically uses the JavaScript version as a fallback, ensuring the extension continues to work during the migration process.

## Development Workflow

1. **Start development mode:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This compiles TypeScript and copies static files to the `dist/` directory.

2. **Make changes to TypeScript files:**
   - Edit `.ts` files in the `src/` directory
   - Run `npm run build` to rebuild after changes
   - Check the console for compilation status

3. **Test the extension:**
   - Load the `dist/` directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome
   - The extension will use compiled TypeScript where possible, JavaScript fallbacks otherwise

4. **Check types:**
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```
   This shows TypeScript errors without affecting the build.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails Completely

- Check that Node.js and npm are installed
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Try `npm run clean && npm run build`

### TypeScript Compilation Errors

- The build system is designed to continue working even with TypeScript errors
- JavaScript fallbacks are used automatically
- Use `npm run type-check` to see all TypeScript issues
- Fix TypeScript errors gradually without breaking the extension

### Extension Not Loading

- Ensure the `dist/` directory exists and contains `manifest.json`
- Check Chrome's extension management page for error messages
- Verify that all required files are present in `dist/`

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete TypeScript Migration**: Fix remaining type errors to enable full TypeScript compilation
2. **Source Maps**: Enable source maps for better debugging
3. **Minification**: Add minification for production builds
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Add tools to analyze bundle size and dependencies
