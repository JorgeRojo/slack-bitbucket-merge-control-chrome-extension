# Bug 001: Toggle Switch Incorrect State After Browser Restart

## Component
`popup-toggle-feature-status.ts`

## Date Reported
2025-07-24

## Status
Fixed

## Severity
Medium - Functionality works but UI is misleading

## Reproduce

1. Switch off the toggleSwitch (countdown starts)
2. Close the browser
3. Open the browser again
4. Open the extension popup

## Current wrong behavior

The toggleSwitch is displayed as ON even though the feature is disabled and the countdown is active.

## Expected right behavior

The toggleSwitch should start as OFF because the feature is disabled and the countdown is displayed.

## Root Cause

The toggle switch component was interpreting any value for the 'checked' attribute (even 'false') as a truthy value. When setting `toggleSwitch.setAttribute('checked', 'false')`, the component still considered it as "checked" because the attribute existed.

## Fix Summary

The issue was fixed by changing how the toggle switch's checked state is managed in the `initializeToggleFeatureStatus` function:

```typescript
// Changed from:
toggleSwitch.setAttribute('checked', featureEnabled ? 'true' : 'false');

// To:
if (featureEnabled) {
  toggleSwitch.setAttribute('checked', 'checked');
} else {
  toggleSwitch.removeAttribute('checked');
}
```

By completely removing the attribute when the feature is disabled, the toggle switch now correctly shows as OFF when the feature is disabled.

## Tests Added/Modified

1. Updated tests for feature enabled/disabled states to verify the new behavior
2. Added a new test specifically for the bug scenario (feature disabled with active countdown)
3. Added a test for the COUNTDOWN_COMPLETED message handler
