# Feature 001: Refactor UI to React for Popup and Options Pages

[GitHub Issue #52](https://github.com/JorgeRojo/slack-bitbucket-merge-control-chrome-extension/issues/52)

## Component
`src/modules/options/* and src/modules/content/*`

## Date Requested
2025-08-05

## Priority
Medium

## Description
The solution is to migrate the front-end architecture to React to create a more modern, robust, and scalable codebase. This is a technical refactoring task and should not introduce any new user-facing functionality; the extension must function exactly as it did before the change.
